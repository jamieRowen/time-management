# About

I use Google Calendar to plan and distribute my workload. Planned works are
added as calendar events, with a client and project ID added to the event
description.

Internal policy requires the upkeep of a Google Sheet to summarise all upcoming
and planned works. This report was created to summarise my upcoming planned
works, as according to my Google Calendar, in the format required for our
internal Google Sheet.

```{python python-imports, echo=FALSE}
from jrtimeman.base import Planner
from datetime import datetime
```

```{python fetch-plans, echo=FALSE}
planner = Planner()
plans = planner.get_plans()
```

# Weekly plans

```{python display-plans, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Loop over weeks
for week in plans["week"].unique():

    # Extract data from given week
    week_events = plans[plans["week"] == week]

    # Convert week number back to date
    week_date = datetime.strptime(f"{datetime.now().year}-W{week}" + "-1", "%Y-W%W-%w").date()

    # Display data
    print(f"## Week {week} (beginning: {week_date})")
    print(week_events[["proj", "details", "allotted"]].rename(
              columns={"proj": "Project",
                       "allotted": "Planned Time (Hours)",
                       "details": "Details"}).astype(str).to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".2f"))
