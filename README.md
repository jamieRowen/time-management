## About

This repo contains code to assist in time-management related tasks carried-out
as part of my role at [Jumping Rivers Ltd](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/about/).

[`time-sheet/report.Rmd`](time-sheet/report.Rmd) uses daily "clocked on" and
"clocked off" events from my google calendar to assess my working patterns.
This report is deployed to https://jr-jack.jmpr.io/timesheet/ and is updated
hourly.

[`time-planner/report.Rmd`](timesheet/) uses events from my google calendar to
summarise my upcoming and scheduled / allotted client and project time.
