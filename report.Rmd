The intention of this report is _not_ to provide a breakdown of how much time
Jack spent working on which tasks and with which clients. Rather, the intention
is to answer the higher level question of "how much time has Jack spent at
work?". The data used in this report comes from daily "clocked on" and "clocked
off" tasks manually added to Jack's calendar.
