## About

The intention of this report is _not_ to provide a breakdown of how much time
Jack spent working on which tasks and with which clients. Rather, the intention
is to answer the higher level question of "how much time has Jack spent at
work?".

The data used in this report comes from daily "clocked on" and "clocked off"
tasks manually added to Jack's calendar.

## Overall

```{python echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
summary = sheet.summarise(n=365)
for period in ["Day", "Week"]:
    key = f"Average Working {period} (mean)"
    print(f"### {key}: {summary[key]:.2f} Hours")
```


## Last 5 days

```{python echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
days = 5
summary = sheet.summarise(n=days)
for key, value in summary.items():
    if key != "Average Working Week (mean)":
        print(f"### {key}: {value:.2f} Hours")
```

```{python echo=FALSE}
fig, ax = sheet.boxplot(days)
plt.show()
```

## Last 30 days

```{python echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
days = 30
summary = sheet.summarise(n=days)
for key, value in summary.items():
    print(f"### {key}: {value:.2f} Hours")
```

```{python echo=FALSE}
fig, ax = sheet.boxplot(days)
plt.show()
```

## Last 90 days

```{python echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
days = 90
summary = sheet.summarise(n=days)
for key, value in summary.items():
    print(f"### {key}: {value:.2f} Hours")
```

```{python echo=FALSE}
fig, ax = sheet.time_series(days)
plt.show()
```
